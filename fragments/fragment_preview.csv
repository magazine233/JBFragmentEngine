We have many strong security processes and protections in place across our digital platforms. The table below outlines just some of the measures we take to protect your details.
               
                
                 Security measure
                 How it works
                
                
                 Security review
                 The security review will prompt you to review and update your account security settings as needed. This will support you to protect your myGov account against cyber threats and unauthorised access.
                
                
                 2 factor authentication for myGov sign in details sign in option
                 To sign in to myGov using myGov sign in details, you enter your username and password, and either:
                  
                   a code sent by SMS
                   a code from the myGov Code Generator app
                   an answer to a secret question.
                  
                
                
                 Digital ID sign in option
                 You have the option to sign in to myGov using your secure Digital ID. Digital ID offers a strong level of security to protect your account.
                
                
                 Passkeys sign in option
                 You have the option to sign in to myGov using a passkey. Passkeys offer a strong level of security to protect your account.
                
                
                 Fingerprint or facial recognition myGov app sign in option
                 If you have fingerprint or face recognition set up on your device, you can choose to use it to sign in to the myGov app.
                
                
                 Lockouts
                 If your password, 2 factor authentication code or answer to your secret question is entered incorrectly too many times in a row, we temporarily lock your myGov account. If you continue to enter it incorrectly, your account may be permanently locked.
                
                
                 Compromised account closure
                 If we get information to suggest your myGov sign in details have been compromised, we’ll close your account. myGov collects information from a range of government agencies including the Australian Cyber Security Centre.
                
                
                 Prompt to change password
                 If we notice suspicious sign in attempts on your account, we’ll send a security notification email and prompt you to change your password the next time you sign in.
                
                
                 Encryption
                 Your details are securely encrypted and stored in Australia. We only share them with your linked services with your consent. They are protected by strict security protocols.
                
                
                 Time outs
                 If you don’t sign out of your myGov account, it will automatically sign out after 15 minutes.
                
                
                 Security notifications
                 If we notice sign in activity from a new device or changes to your sign in settings, we’ll send you a security notification email to make sure it was you who accessed your account. Note security notifications are different to myGov notifications. You can choose to be notified by SMS, email or push notifications for myGov notifications when you have a new message in your myGov Inbox or a new myGov task.
                
                
                 Closure of inactive accounts
                 We may close accounts that have not been used after a certain amount of time. We may do so when:
                  
                   your myGov account has been permanently locked
                   you have not signed in for 6 months since creating the account and have no linked services
                   you have not signed in for 24 months.
